Have you ever wanted to host a Minecraft server, but you don't have a good enough computer?
Here is the solution to all your problems! With one Â£5 purchase, you can have a Minecraft server that can handle up to one player!

This *is* sarcastic btw. 

## Features
- [x] Basic protocol support
- [x] Displays the MOTD
- [ ] Allows connections
- [ ] Has any gameplay

## Building
PicoCraft is built using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and is therefore a requirement for building and running. 

Just run:
```
cargo run
```
and your server will be up and running!

## License
PicoCraft is licensed under Mozilla Public License 2.0 unless otherwise stated.
